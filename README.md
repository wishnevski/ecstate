<!-- ------------------------ ECSTATE ------------------------ -->


# ECState

**ECState** is the fastest lightweight [ECS](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) *(Entity Component System)* library with a minimalistic API, working on archetypes ([SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA)) and written in JavaScript.

Based on JS tests, the way of processing data in the form of *struct of arrays* (SOA) is up to 30% faster than an *array of structures* (AOS), although it is not a *cache-friendly* way of iterating, as in most native C-like languages.

Also, this approach adds flexibility in handling the components of the created application.


<!-- ------------------------ FEATURES ------------------------ -->


## Features

- Simple <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_(principle)">KISS</a>-like API.
- Entity is just a numeric identifier.
- Archetypes and queries are generated automatically in realtime.
- Iterative queries and switching entities between archetypes are cached for better performance.
- Hooks for adding and removing components are strictly absent, since they do not fit into the philosophy of a pure ECS approach.
- The implementation of the systems remains at the discretion of the developer, since methods and patterns of organizing update logic for each project are different.


<!-- ------------------------ INSTALLING ------------------------ -->


## Installing

You can install the library using the `npm` package manager:

```
npm install ecstate
```

Note that Node [ES6](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) module loader does not support the `NODE_PATH` environment variable as per the [specification](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_no_node_path). Therefore, modules that will be imported into Node via the `import` specifier must be installed in the local directory `node_modules` without the `-g` flag. Otherwise, you will receive the `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error.


<!-- ------------------------ IMPORTING ------------------------ -->


## Importing


[UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd/) module import looks like this:

```javascript
var { ECState } = require('ecstate'); // ecstate/build/ecstate.umd.cjs
```

ES6 import looks like this:

```javascript
import { ECState } from 'ecstate'; // ecstate/build/ecstate.module.mjs
```

If you want to use the library in a browser without a bundler, you can copy `ecstate/build/ecstate.umd.cjs` or `ecstate/build/ecstate.module.mjs` to your project folder and include it directly in html.

**UMD** in browser:

```html
<script src="./ecstate.umd.cjs"></script>
<script>
  var { ECState } = ECState; // ECState is an object that contains the necessary function constructors, including ECState constructor.
</script>
```

**ES6** in browser:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { ECState } from './ecstate.module.mjs';
</script>
```


<!-- ------------------------ EXAMPLE ------------------------ -->


## Example

```javascript

import { ECState } from 'ecstate';


/* ----------- COMPONENTS ----------- */


function Transform()
{
  this.position = { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };
}


function Body()
{
  this.mass = 10;
  this.static = false;
  this.velocity = { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };
}


function Collider()
{
  this.radius = 50;
  this.collide = false;
}


/* ----------- INIT ----------- */


var state = new ECState;


/* ----------- ENTITIES ----------- */


// all library functions take component constructor functions as arguments, not already instantiated objects

var id1 = state.addEntity(Transform); // creates an entity with one component (return integer number: 0)
var id2 = state.addEntity(Transform, Body, Collider); // creates an entity with three components (return integer number: 1)
var id3 = state.addEntity(); // creates an empty entity (return integer number: 2)

var result4 = state.addComponent(id1, Body, Collider); // adds two components to the entity (return "true")
var result5 = state.removeComponent(id2, Body, Collider); // removes two components from an entity (return "true")


var body1 = state.getComponent(id1, Body); // return Body component instance

body1.mass = 10;

body1.velocity.x = 20;
body1.velocity.y = 20;
body1.velocity.z = 20;


var body2 = state.getComponent(id2, Body); // return "null", because this entity no longer has Body component


// after deleting entities, their ids are freed and will be automatically reused by the library for new entities

state.removeEntity(id1); // return "true"
state.removeEntity(id1); // return "false", because this entity has already been removed

state.addEntity(Transform, Body, Collider); // return 0, not 3


/* ----------- QUERY ----------- */


state.query([Transform, Body], function({ Transform: transforms, Body: bodies }, ids)
{
  // The callback is called on every non-empty archetype containing the "Transform" and "Body" component types.
  // For example, if we have 10 entities with (Transform, Body) and 5 entities with (Transform, Body, Collider), then the callback is called 2 times for each archetype.
  // Inside the callback, the user himself iterates over the necessary components using "for".

  for(let i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) // The length of the ids array is always equal to the lengths of the component arrays
  {
    let transform = transforms[i];
    let body = bodies[i];
    let id = ids[i];

    if(body.mass > 0 && body.static === false)
    {
      transform.position.x += body.velocity.x / body.mass;
      transform.position.y += body.velocity.y / body.mass;
      transform.position.z += body.velocity.z / body.mass;
    }
  }
});
```


<!-- ------------------------ WORKING PRINCIPLE AND PRECAUTIONS ------------------------ -->


# Working principle and Precautions


<!-- ----------- ARCHETYPES ----------- -->


## Archetypes

All components (i.e. entities) are stored in archetypes. An archetype is a structure of arrays: arrays of components and one array with entity IDs.

For example, let's imagine two archetypes: the first holds entities consisting of two components `Transform` and `Body`, and the second contains entities with only the `Transform` component. This means that the first archetype is an object with 3 arrays: `Transform`, `Body` and `ids`. And the second archetype, respectively - `Transform` and `ids`. The `ids` array is created by the library and is an auxiliary one - it stores the `id` of entities.

`Each entity has the same index in all arrays of the archetype`.


<!-- ----------- ADDING ENTITIES ----------- -->


## Adding entities

When you create an entity with some components via `addEntity()`, the library checks if an archetype exists with the same set of component arrays. If not, he creates it. Then it adds new entity components to the end of the arrays of this archetype, and its `id` to the `ids` array. Subsequently, this approach allows you to quickly iterate over the required entities. (In native C-like languages, such iterations are done in a *cache-fiendly* manner, which greatly improves performance)

It should be noted that the entity can be empty, i.e. do not have any components. It is put into an archetype that has only one `ids` array.


<!-- ----------- REMOVING ENTITIES ----------- -->


## Removing entities

When you remove an entity with `removeEntity()`, the library gets an archetype, which contains the components of the entity specified by `id`, and its index in the archetype arrays. Then, components of the last entity in archetype are put in place of the components of the entity to be removed. After that, all arrays of the archetype are automatically shortened by `Array.pop()`.

For example, an entity has 3 components `Transform`,` Body`, `Collider`, which means it is in an archetype with 4 arrays - `Transform`, `Body`, `Collider` and `ids`. Let's say there are 10 entities inside the archetype - this means that the length of each array is 10. However, the entity we are removing has index 3 in each array. (entity components have the same position in arrays)

To quickly remove an entity at index 3, the library takes the components at index 10 (i.e. the last entity) and puts them in place 3 in all arrays. Then, each array is shortened.


<!-- ----------- MODIFYING ENTITIES ----------- -->


## Modifying entities

When you add or remove components from an entity via `addComponent()` and `removeComponent()`, the library is looking for an archetype with a new (changed) list of entity components. If there is no such thing, it creates it. Then it transfers the components from the old archetype to the new one. If the operation of removing components is performed, then the extra ones are simply discarded. If the operation of adding components is performed, they are automatically created during the transfer.

In the old archetype, components are simply removed.


<!-- ------------------------ FAQ ------------------------ -->


# FAQ


### Why there are no add and remove hooks?


Hooks in **ECS** are a dirty way to transfer information between systems that modify entities or react to these modifications. In compiled programming languages, this is also not a very productive feature within the *Data Oriented* approach.

Therefore, the philosophy of `ECState` is based on the fact that any information (including state changes) and any data should be transmitted only through components.


### Why there are no systems?


`ECState` is a library, not a framework, so it does not impose any patterns for organizing logic handlers. Their implementation remains on the shoulders of the developer of a specific project. Functionality of `ECState` remains in one area of responsibility - convenient storage and fast modification of the state (world) of the application.


### Why ES6 syntax is not used to declare components?


**First**, from a syntactic point of view, declaring a component as a constructor function is much more compact than as a class.

**Secondly**, classes in JS are not independent abstractions, but just syntactic sugar.

**Third**, in ECS architecture, a component is usually a [POD](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_data_structure) type that does not have control code. Therefore, in JavaScript, a simple constructor function is best suited for this data type.

Using constructors as arguments to library API functions adds rigor to the code by not allowing random instances to be passed inside state.


### Can entities be modified during logic update iterations?


During an iterative update of components in an archetype, modifying the current or early updated entity will cause the loop to skip the one that will be moved from the end to the place of the modified one. This is described in detail in the section [Working principle and Precautions](#working-principle-and-precautions).

Чтобы не происходило пропуска, есть два решения под каждый случай:
- если модифицируется сущность, обновляемая в данный момент, то используется *decreasing the index of a `for` loop*.
- если модифицируется произваольная сущность в текущем архетипе, то используется *separate modification cycle*.


**Decreasing the index of a `for` loop**:


```javascript
state.query([Transform, Body], function({ Transform: transforms, Body: bodies }, ids)
{
  for(let i = 0; i < ids.length; i++)
  {
    // ...any update logic

    if(body.haveIntersects === true)
    {
      state.addComponent(ids[i], Collided);
      i--;
    }
  }
});
```


**Separate modification cycle**:


```javascript
var modify = [];


state.query([Transform, Body], function({ Transform: transforms, Body: bodies }, ids)
{
  for(let i = 0; i < ids.length; i++)
  {
    // ...any logic

    if(body.intersects) modify.push(ids[i]);
  }
});


for(let i = 0; i < modify.length; i++)
{
  state.addComponent(modify[i], Collided);
}
```


<!-- ------------------------ DOCUMENTATION ------------------------ -->


# Documentation


<!-- ----------- INIT ----------- -->


## Init


```javascript
var state = new ECState;
```


<!-- ----------- ENTITY ----------- -->


## Entity


<!-- addEntity() -->


#### `addEntity(component1 : function, ...) : number`

Creates a new entity and returns its `id`. Component constructor functions are passed as arguments; however, the entity can be empty.


<!-- removeEntity() -->


#### `removeEntity(id : number) : boolean`

Removes an entity by `id`. Returns `true` if the deletion was successful. Returns `false` if the entity with the passed `id` does not exist.

`After deleting entities, their ids are freed and will be automatically reused by the library for new entities.`


<!-- ----------- COMPONENTS ----------- -->


## Components


<!-- addComponent() -->


#### `addComponent(id : number, component1 : function, ...) : boolean`

Adds components to an entity with the passed `id` whose constructors were passed as arguments. Returns `true` if the addition was successful.


<!-- removeComponent() -->


#### `removeComponent(id : number, component1 : function, ...) : boolean`

Removes entity components with `id` passed in, whose constructors were passed as arguments. Returns `true` if the deletion was successful.


<!-- getComponent() -->


#### `getComponent(id : number, component : function) : [object, null]`

Returns the instance of the entity component with the passed `id`, whose constructor was passed as an argument. If no such component or entity exists, returns `null`.


<!-- ----------- QUERY ----------- -->


## Query


<!-- query() -->


#### `query(components : array, callback : function)`

Iterates over the archetypes containing the specified components. Callback is called provided that the archetype is not empty. (i.e. contains at least one entity)

An array with component constructor functions and callback is passed as an arguments.

The callback passes two arguments: an object with arrays of archetype components, and an array of entity IDs.

`The length of the id array is always equal to the lengths of the component arrays.`

```javascript
state.query([Transform, Body], function(components, ids)
{
  // The callback is called on every non-empty archetype containing the "Transform" and "Body" component types.
  // For example, if we have 10 entities with (Transform, Body) and 5 entities with (Transform, Body, Collider), then the callback is called 2 times for each archetype.
  // Inside the callback, the user himself iterates over the necessary components using "for".

  for(let i = 0; i < ids.length; i++)
  {
    let transform = components.Transform[i];
    let body = components.Body[i];
    let id = ids[i];

    // do anything with "transform" or "body"
  }
});
```

Note, however, that in [ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) it is most convenient to use [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) for quick access to arrays of components.

```javascript
// use destructuring assignment with rename

state.query([Transform, Body], function({ Transform: transforms, Body: bodies }, ids)
{
  for(let i = 0; i < ids.length; i++)
  {
    let transform = transforms[i];
    let body = bodies[i];
    let id = ids[i];

    // do anything with "transform" or "body"
  }
});
```
